These are the assignment queries that I have solved successfully
Problem 1: Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
Problem 2: List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.
Problem 3: List all case numbers for crimes  involving minors?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
Problem 4: List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?
Problem 5: What kind of crimes were recorded at schools?
Problem 6: List the average safety score for all types of schools.
Problem 7: List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line.
Problem 8: Which community area(number) is most crime prone?
Problem 9: Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index.
Problem 10: Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?


Week 6:
Generate joins to query data from multiple tables.
Create stored procedures and invoke them from other code.
Describe the significance of ACID transactions.

Create and query a view.

These are the assignment queries that I have solved successfully:
Exercise 1, Question 1:Write and execute a SQL query to list the school names, community names and average attendance for communities with a hardship index of 98. 
Exercise 1, Question 2: 
Write and execute a SQL query to list all crimes that took place at a school. Include case number, crime type and community name.
Exercise 2, Question 1: 
Write and execute a SQL statement that returns just the school name and leadersâ€™ icon from the view. 
Exercise 3, Question 1: 
Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer. Don't forget to use the #SET TERMINATOR statement to use the @ for the CREATE statement terminator. 
Exercise 3, Question 2: 
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the in_Leader_Score parameter. 
Exercise 3, Question 3: 
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information. 
Exercise 3, Question 4: 
Run your code to create the stored procedure.
Exercise 4, Question 1: 
Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement that rolls back the current work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories. 
Exercise 4, Question 2: 
Update your stored procedure definition again. Add a statement to commit the current unit of work at the end of the procedure.
